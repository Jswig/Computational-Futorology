Open-ended project in Computational Futurology, Fall 2018, taught by Peter Rothman.

In this assignement, our goal was to devise a method to evaluate the claim that Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto (the author of the Bitcoin
white paper), using the available textual  evidence.

My approach used text statistics unsupervised learning techniques to compare the similarities in writing style between the two.
While I didn't find any conclusicve evidence in either direction, it was an interesting exercise
