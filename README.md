# Computational Futurology
*Anders Poirel*

Contains the open-ended projects I built in the Computational Futurology course taught by Peter Rothman in Fall 2018 at U.C. Santa Cruz, as part of the College Scholars Program.


| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Who is Satoshi?]() | I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto |
| [The Penny Game]()| I design a finite-state automaton that plays an optimal strategy for the ``Penny Game'' |
| [How Predictable Are You]() | I design a simple method using Markov Chains to predict movement of players on a random grid
