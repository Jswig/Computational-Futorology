# Computational Futurology
*Anders Poirel*

Contains the open-ended projects I built in the Computational Futurology course taught by Peter Rothman in Fall 2018 at U.C. Santa Cruz, as part of the College Scholars Program.


| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Who is Satoshi?](https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf) | I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto |
| [The Penny Game]()| I design a finite-state automaton that plays a game-theoretic optimal strategy for the ``Penny Game'' |
| [How Predictable Are You?]() | I design a simple method using Markov Chains to predict movement of players on a random grid 
| [Access to Birth Control in the U.S.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DtbDNyi160zuXgVyBocp7d1TX9Zl3crS) | Open-ended final group project in which we use regression to predict access to birth control on a state basis. |
